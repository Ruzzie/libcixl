= Cixl - The Tiny Text Console Game Library

First things

- structure libcixl
- create build pipeline
- colored / decorated cixl strings
- game loop
- pure c ansivt demo
- netcore demo

== Constraints
- must also compile with openwatcom
- at least cross platform (ish) c interface
- must be able to interop with netcore
- when complex internal / dependencies are needed, prefer rust over cpp, has easier dev env. experience
- no restrictive licensing

== Goals
- Fun constraints for game development!
- Can create a game under 1.44MB
- Runs on windows32/64 and Dos (16)
    * Separate rendering: can be Terminal / Text / Conio / Console / SDL / Bearlib / SadConsole etc.
    * Pure text only
- Keyboard input
- SoundFx + Music
    * FM synthesis (emulation / real hw) to reduce size
    * Tracker player
- Text based
- Ascii High / Extended graphics (CP 437)
- 256 colors (ish)
- Framework can be used as library (multi-platform)
- Can be used in other game frameworks
- core libs don't use os dependent features (nostdlib)
- reusable for mud, ascii / text games

=== Needed stuff
- Tiny Statemachine for state transitions
- Easy Screen / Scene management / states
- Root / Subconsoles
- Layers in graphics
- simple (e)cs system updates
- pathfinding
- animations
